            <h2>My Android Project</h2>
            <p>Originally, this was planned as an activity to make use of my Raspberry Pi 3: deploy TeamCity (which I’d not used before) and build an Android application. The main issue with the Raspberry Pi is that it uses an ARM chipset, which cannot compile Android SDK binaries and so couldn’t build the artefacts. This meant moving to an AMD/Intel processor to build the software successfully. Using an old PC found in my parents’ loft and adding a couple of extra gigs of RAM, I flattened the machine, installed Debian, MySQL and TeamCity and can now pick up commits to GitHub and automatically build the resulting APK. The build server can be found at http://chrisp1985.ddns.net:8111 . </p>
            <p>The development of the Android software itself is/was a bit of a pain. Android Studio is based off Intelli J so was immediately familiar, but having to edit XML as well as some not-fantastically-well-documented Java made the process a bit tricky. For instance, using a custom typeface isn’t as easy as selecting the text and choosing the font in the visual editor, you have to set the type on creation of the fragment in the Java code. And working out that I needed to open a fragment from the drawer, and then finding out how to do that, wasn’t easy. The intention of this was to create an application that I could test against with Appium, but as Appium requires a) a VTX enabled CPU (which my old PC doesn’t have) or b) a connected Android device (which I don’t have spare), the Appium tests are currently ignored for builds. My focus currently is on creating a relatively solid app, so that any tests I create can check a consistent build rather than one that is liable to drastically change.</p>
            <p>As this is an ongoing project, there are likely to be changes and updates to this page...</p>
