            <h2>This WebSite</h2>
            <p>My intention in creating this site was to a) show the coding I've done so far and b) have a play around with the bits I've been learning about outside of work. </p>

            <h2>What's in it?</h2>
            <p>The main tab control in the Tools section, for instance, uses an angular controller to set the active tab. The accordion element that houses the code is jquery.</p>
            <p>There's a bit of CSS dotted about, but mainly I'm just using what boostrap gives you with a few additional bits. The CSS for the code block was from prism (see the source).</p>

            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>The reason I've put this together is basically to learn more background info on the web apps I test, and to understand what I should or shouldn't be hooking into. For instance, I know that an ng-init has its uses in early designs, but really any initialisation code should be going into a controller. The less logic in HTML the better.</p>
            <p>This isn't a comprehensive website by any means but hopefully demonstrates a bit of understanding about what I'm testing.</p>
